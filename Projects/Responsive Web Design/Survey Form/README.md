My first portfolio project on freeCodeCamp.
A survey form for a club at Penn State Harrisburg related to engineering an off-road racecar building/racing competition called Baja SAE.
Survey form is intended to collect potential members' information such as year, interests, motivations, and involvement in STEM while being aesthetically pleasing.

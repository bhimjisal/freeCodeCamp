This is my second portfolio project on freeCodeCamp. 
It is a tribute page dedicated to my all-time favorite football players, Cristiano Ronaldo. 
The page includes a photograph of Ronaldo and a brief timeline mapping out his legacy and achievements.
Near the bottom, the page includes a quote from the man himself as well as a link to his Wikipedia entry in case users would like to learn more.
The HTML was the most complicated part of this project while the CSS was kept relatively simple for a clean look.

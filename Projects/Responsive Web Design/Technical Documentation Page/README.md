This JavaScript technical documentation page was created by me  in order to learn and practice HTML and CSS further. I practiced creating a functional nav bar and a table while making all components responsive. One aspect of the project that gave me trouble was the nav bar itself. I could not figure out how to make the nav bar stick to the upper-left hand side of the screen when the user scrolled down the page. This was a very easy fix in hindsight since all I had to do was set the position element to fixed. I also thought making the page responsive was a bit tricky.
One thing that I plan to do in my next responsive web design project to make it easier on myself to make any page responsive is to using % instead of pixel values so the page is almost entirely resposive by default. This project was over 500 lines of HTML and 200 lines of CSS, making it my longest project to date. With final exams and winter break with family, this project took longer than expected, but I hope to continue forward with spped as the spring semester starts up again now.
Once again, I am a junior at Penn State studying Mechanical Engineering full-time so finding time is always hard, especially after all my extracurriculars and with my co-op starting soon.
As always, I would love to connect on GitHub and Twitter and you can track my projects in real-time on Twitter @bhimjisal.
